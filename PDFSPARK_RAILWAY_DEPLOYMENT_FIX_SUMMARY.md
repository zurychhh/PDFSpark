# PDFSpark Railway Docker Deployment Fix - Summary

## Problem Solved
The Docker build for PDFSpark on Railway was failing with errors like:

```
âœ• COPY backend/ ./ 
failed to calculate checksum of ref: "/backend": not found
```

This was happening because Railway's build context did not contain the expected files.

## Solution

We've implemented a robust solution with the following components:

1. **Self-contained Dockerfile** that doesn't rely on external files
2. **Fixed Railway configuration** in a single railway.json file
3. **Memory fallback mechanism** for Railway's ephemeral environment
4. **Optimized environment variables** for Railway deployment

## Quick Instructions

To fix your Railway deployment, run:

```bash
./quick-railway-docker-fix.sh
```

This script will automatically apply all necessary fixes and deploy to Railway.

## Detailed Instructions

For more control over the fix process, use these scripts:

1. **Test Docker build locally**:
   ```bash
   ./test-docker-build.sh
   ```

2. **Fix and deploy interactively**:
   ```bash
   ./fix-railway-docker-deploy.sh
   ```

3. **Diagnose Railway deployment**:
   ```bash
   ./diagnose-railway-deployment.sh
   ```
