2. **railway.json**
   - Configures Railway deployment
   - Sets up health checks
   - Defines restart policies

3. **Deploy Scripts**
   - `deploy-railway-backend.sh` - Automates backend deployment
   - `update-api-url.sh` - Updates frontend to use Railway API URL

4. **Documentation**

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be set in Railway:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | Cloudinary cloud name | None (required) |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` | Cloudinary API key | None (required) |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | Cloudinary API secret | None (required) |
| `USE_MEMORY_FALLBACK` | Enables memory storage fallback | true |
| `NODE_OPTIONS` | Node.js runtime options | --max-old-space-size=2048 |
| `PORT` | Server port | 3000 |

## Deployment Process

1. **Backend Deployment**
   ```bash
   ./deploy-railway-backend.sh
   ```

2. **Frontend Configuration**
   ```bash
   ./update-api-url.sh
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check the `/health` endpoint of your Railway deployment
   - Test file uploads and conversions
   - Monitor the logs for any issues

## Troubleshooting
