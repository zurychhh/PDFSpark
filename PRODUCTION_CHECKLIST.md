## Remaining Tasks

The following tasks need to be completed manually for full production deployment:

### Backend Implementation
1. Develop a complete API that matches the interface expected by the frontend
2. Implement all required endpoints:
   - `/files/upload` - For uploading files
   - `/convert` - For starting conversions
   - `/operations/{id}/status` - For checking conversion status
   - `/operations/{id}/download` - For downloading results
   - `/operations/{id}/preview` - For getting result previews

### Infrastructure Setup
1. Set up cloud storage (AWS S3 or equivalent) for storing uploaded files and conversion results
2. Configure CDN for content delivery
3. Set up proper CORS policies on the backend
4. Configure monitoring and logging services

### Domain & SSL
1. Register and configure your domain (pdfspark.com)
2. Set up SSL certificates for secure connections
3. Configure DNS records for your services

### Payment Processing (for Premium Features)
1. Set up Stripe or another payment processor
2. Implement payment flow and webhooks
3. Configure pricing and subscription options

### Analytics & Monitoring
1. Set up Google Analytics or similar service
2. Configure error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
3. Set up performance monitoring
4. Create dashboards for key metrics

### Security
1. Implement proper security headers
2. Configure CORS policies
3. Set up rate limiting
4. Implement malware scanning for uploaded files

## Deployment Process

1. Finish backend implementation
2. Deploy backend services
3. Update frontend environment variables to point to the real backend
4. Deploy frontend using one of the methods in DEPLOYMENT.md
5. Verify functionality in production environment
6. Set up monitoring and alerts

## Regular Maintenance

- Monitor error logs and address issues
- Update dependencies regularly
- Backup data and configuration
- Monitor security advisories and apply patches
- Review analytics data to improve user experience
